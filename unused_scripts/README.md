This directory contains scripts that either weren't used to generate data for the manuscript, or were never debugged. Archiving here until we confirm these aren't needed and can delete.

### calc_IPR_frequency.py
This script counts the number of IPR signatures (i.e. protein domains) associated with the HK sequences at the DeMMO sites. It calculates frequency metrics for how often each IPR signature occurs in the DeMMO site(s).
I don't think we actually used this in the MS, might be able to remove

### seqtk_error_check.py
This script was written to make sure we were pulling out all the HK sequences from the proteome files. (We were. Not sure this is necessary to include)
