# DeMMOworkflow

This project consists of a series of scripts to use [InterProScan](https://github.com/ebi-pf-team/interproscan) to identify two component system (TCS) proteins from prokaryotic genomes. Specifically these are processing scripts to count TCSs and pull out their sequences after being run through InterProScan. Filter code should be run before 

Filter code requires downloaded HK and RR true and false lists to run.
